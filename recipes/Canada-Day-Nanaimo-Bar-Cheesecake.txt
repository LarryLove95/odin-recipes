<h2>Description</h2>

<p> The taste of a Nanaimo bar in a cheesecake! Can't get any better than this. Make in the jelly roll pan for serving a larger crowd. 
Result is thinner but still as tasty. (You will need to adjust baking time if you use the bigger pan.)</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>

  <li>2 ½ cups crushed chocolate cream-filled sandwich cookies (such as OREO® Cookies)</li>
  <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
  <li>¼ cup chopped pecans</li>
  <li>½ cup flaked coconut</li>
  <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
  <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup custard powder (such as Bird's® Custard Powder)</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
  <li>6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate</li>
  <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>

  <li><p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>

  <li>
<p>Stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, pecans, and coconut in a bowl until 
the mixture is well combined. Press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, and 
refrigerate while making filling.</p></li>

  <li>
<p>Beat cream cheese, sugar, and custard powder in a large bowl with an electric mixer
until light and fluffy, and beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating each until fully 
incorporated before adding the next. Layer the filling over the crust.</p></li>

  <li>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 40 minutes. 
Refrigerate the cheesecake until fully cold, at least 3 hours.</p></li>

  <li>
<p>Melt the semisweet chocolate in a saucepan over very low heat with the cream, and 
stir until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Pour the chocolate mixture over the 
cheesecake, spread with a spatula to cover the middle layer, and refrigerate until the 
topping is firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve cold. Store leftovers in refrigerator.</p></li>
